# 🧠 AlexNet Implementation

Welcome to the **AlexNet Implementation** repository! This project provides a clean and straightforward implementation of the AlexNet deep learning architecture for image classification tasks.

## 📚 Overview

AlexNet is a pioneering Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that significantly advanced the field of deep learning. This notebook walks through the architecture’s layers, providing insights into how it processes and classifies images.

## ✨ Features

- **Layer-by-Layer Explanation**: Detailed descriptions of each layer in the AlexNet architecture.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Ready-to-use code for training on custom datasets.
- **Visualizations**: Insights into feature maps, filters, and activations.
- **Modular Code**: Easily customizable and extendable for different applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alexnet-implementation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd alexnet-implementation
    ```
3. Open and run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook AlexNet.ipynb
    ```

## 📊 Dataset

This implementation can be adapted to work with any image classification dataset. Simply update the data loading section in the notebook to use your own dataset.

## 🖼️ Visualizations

The notebook includes visualizations of:
- Feature maps and filter activations
- Training and validation performance
